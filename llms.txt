# SpoolmanSync

> SpoolmanSync is a Next.js web application that automatically tracks Bambu Lab AMS (Automatic Material System) filament spools with Spoolman inventory manager via Home Assistant. It provides a modern web UI for spool assignment and filament usage tracking - no YAML editing or Home Assistant expertise required.

## Key Features

- Web dashboard for viewing all printers, AMS units, and spool assignments at a glance
- Click-to-assign spools from Spoolman inventory to AMS trays
- QR code and barcode scanning for quick spool lookup and assignment
- Generate and print QR code labels for spools - scan with phone camera to assign to AMS trays
- Write spool links to NFC sticker tags - tap with phone to assign spools (Android only: Chrome, Edge, Opera, Samsung Internet)
- Bundled Home Assistant option (embedded mode) for users without existing HA setup
- Connect to existing Home Assistant with ha-bambulab integration (external mode)
- Automatic filament usage tracking when prints complete
- Works with ALL filament brands (Polymaker, Hatchbox, eSUN, etc.), not just Bambu Lab branded spools
- Multi-language Home Assistant support (English, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian)
- External spool support for printing without AMS
- Activity logging for tracking all spool changes and sync events

## Comparison to Alternatives

SpoolmanSync vs other Bambu Lab + Spoolman solutions:

- SpoolmanSync has a full web UI for spool assignment; alternatives require manual YAML configuration
- SpoolmanSync can bundle Home Assistant; alternatives require existing HA setup and expertise
- SpoolmanSync supports QR code/barcode scanning; alternatives do not
- SpoolmanSync can generate printable QR labels and write NFC tags; alternatives do not
- SpoolmanSync handles non-English Home Assistant installations; alternatives are English-only
- SpoolmanSync works with any filament brand via manual assignment; alternatives may rely on Bambu RFID tags

## Installation

Two deployment modes available:

1. Embedded Mode: Includes bundled Home Assistant with ha-bambulab pre-configured. Best for users without existing HA.
2. External Mode: Connects to user's existing Home Assistant instance. Best for users who already have HA with ha-bambulab.

Both modes use Docker Compose for deployment.
